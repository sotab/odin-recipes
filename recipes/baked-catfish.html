        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked catfish is an easy recepie yet tasty that can be made relatively fast and it's ingredients are
            available in most stores.
        </p>
        <p>The recepie is quite simple, as you just have to do some preparation then wait until it is baked ready.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Catfish fillets</li>
            <li>Lemon</li>
            <li>Almond</li>
            <li>Green olives</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Rosmery</li>
            <li>Thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a baking sheet onto a baking pan and lay out as many catfish fillets as you would like to bake</li>
            <li>Pour some olive oil on top of the fish</li>
            <li>Sprinkle thyme evenly on the fish</li>
            <li>Add fresh rosmery to the pan (if you don't have fresh one you can sprinkle dried one directly onto the
                fish)</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to your liking</li>
            <li>Pour almond and olives onto the fish and into the pan</li>
            <li>Add a few slices of lemon on top of the fish fillets</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with aluminium foil and put it to the oven for about 45 min at 200 celcius degree</li>
            <li>Take off the aluminium foil and bake it for 15 minutes (if you have a grill setting it is a good idea to
                switch to that)</li>
        </ol>
